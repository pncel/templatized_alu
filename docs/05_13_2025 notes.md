UVM is a system verilog library - tool
To do "constrained random testing" using UVM is the goal - strategy
functional coverage to test if testing is effective - is strategy effective

functional coverage ensures that "constrained random testing" hits all corner cases. Must define the corner cases manually
All three points above work together for good testing.

Consider generating separate in logics in muxes and control so that instead of in[0], [1], etc. , do in_add, in_bool
