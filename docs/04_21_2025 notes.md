Logic for the math on op_width generation

Doing log₂(N) would result in the minimum number of bits needed to 
represennt N values in binary. However, results for things such as
log₂(3) ≈ 1.585 cannot be expressed with just 1 bit so we must round up to 2 bits. 

Thus we need math.ceil to perform the rounding on the number of bits to represent N:
                        math.ceil(math.log2(N)))

We also max(1, ...) the guard against when there is only one operation--log₂(1) == 0.0 which would give 0 bits which is not valid thus we force a minimum of 1 bit.
