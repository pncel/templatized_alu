Discussed how to go forward from current stage of project.
Juwon - 
Created software-side logic to handle opcode logic. Used a dictionary to store the supported opcodes and went through what's true and false to determine what the opcode needed to be. 
Had default values for the opcode depending on the width.

Need to work on adjusting opcode logic to work on Ayush's implementation. i.e. instead of using a dictionary to hold user opcodes, use an array and enumerate through it. Have logic that is scalable so that as number of opcodes increases, don't have to constantly change the code.

Ayush - 
Was able to generate add_group alus but did not handle opcodes. 

Future work -
Combine Juwon and Ayush implementations so that it has Ayush's generation but with Juwon's opcode logic. 
Future is to work on gate-level group.
Ensure that opcode and opcode_width can scale to handle the new gate ops.

Create new generation logic so that the generate file will generate or not generate alus if one or more ops specific to their respective group is needed or not needed.

Think about what hierarchy would look like for instantiating multiple alu groups.
